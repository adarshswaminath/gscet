          We, the Computer Science Department, propose to organize a College Coding Kickstart Hackathon aimed at fostering an interest in coding among first, second, third, and final-year students. The primary objective is to provide them with an initial push towards self-learning and the development of coding skills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The College Coding Kickstart Hackathon represents a valuable opportunity for our students to embark on a rewarding journey into coding. This event aligns perfectly with our commitment to providing holistic education that prepares our students for the challenges and opportunities in the modern world.
